# Glucose prediction

The dataset and processed files are in D1NAMO.

The code and graphs are in casos.

The models in tf format are in models.
There are several cases.
Caso_0: There are independent patients. Any of them has 7 experiments (trynumber). There are 6 patients * 7 experiments = 42 models.
        They are generated several times, 1 for each execution. In total 420 models. 
        Maybe it is posible to train them just once, and then save and load, and use them several times for 10 executions.
